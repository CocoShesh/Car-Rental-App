        Book in advance: Booking your rental car ahead of time can often result
        in lower prices. Compare prices from multiple companies: Use websites
        like Kayak, Expedia, or Travelocity to compare prices from multiple
        rental car companies. Look for discount codes and coupons: Search for
        discount codes and coupons that you can use to lower the rental price.
        Renting from an off-airport location can sometimes result in lower
        prices.
